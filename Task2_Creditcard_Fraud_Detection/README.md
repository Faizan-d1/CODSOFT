# Task 2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection (Machine Learning)

## Description
This project builds a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  
The system analyzes transaction details such as amount, category, location, and customer information to classify transactions as   **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses credit card transaction dataset  
- Removes unnecessary and high-cardinality columns  
- Encodes categorical features using **Ordinal Encoding**  
- Handles imbalanced data using class weights and proper evaluation metrics  
- Trains multiple models including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
- Compares model performance and selects the best model  
- Evaluates results using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- Visualizes:
  - Class distribution  
  - Transaction amount distribution  
  - Correlation heatmap  
  - Confusion matrix heatmap  
  - Feature importance  
- Identifies most important features influencing fraud detection  

## How to Run
1. Open terminal or VS Code  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:  
   Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb  
4. Run all cells step by step to:  
   - Preprocess the data  
   - Train multiple models  
   - Evaluate performance  
   - View visualizations
