# Task 1 - Movie Genre Classification (Machine Learning)

## Description
This project builds a Machine Learning model that predicts a movie's genre based on its plot description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The model uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for text feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classification.

## Features
- Loads and processes movie dataset  
- Cleans and preprocesses textual movie descriptions  
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
- Splits data into training and testing sets  
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier  
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Displays results using a **confusion matrix heatmap**  
- Predicts genre for new unseen movie descriptions  
- Saves trained model and vectorizer using **pickle** for future use  

## How to Run
1. Open terminal or VS Code  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:  
   Movie_Genre_Classification.ipynb  
4. Run all cells step by step to:  
   - Preprocess the data  
   - Train the model  
   - Evaluate performance  
   - Test predictions
